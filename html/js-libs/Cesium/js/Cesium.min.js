   1. Definitions

   The terms 'reproduce,' 'reproduction,' 'derivative works,' and 'distribution'
   have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright law.

   A 'contribution' is the original software, or any additions or changes to the software.

   A 'contributor' is any person that distributes its contribution under this license.

   'Licensed patents' are a contributor's patent claims that read directly on its contribution.

   2. Grant of Rights

   (A) Copyright Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
   conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
   worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare
   derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any
   derivative works that you create.

   (B) Patent Grant - Subject to the terms of this license, including the license
   conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a
   non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license under its licensed patents to
   make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose
   of its contribution in the software or derivative works of the contribution
   in the software.

   3. Conditions and Limitations

   (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to use any
   contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.

   (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that
   you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such
   contributor to the software ends automatically.

   (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all
   copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in
   the software.

   (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you
   may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license
   with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in
   compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that
   complies with this license.

   (E) The software is licensed 'as-is.' You bear the risk of using it. The
   contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may
   have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license
   cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors
   exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
   purpose and non-infringement.

   (F) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in sections 2(A) and 2(B)
   extend only to the software or derivative works that you create that run
   on a Microsoft Windows operating system product.
